This project applies K-Means Clustering to categorize countries based on selected numerical features such as economic, health, or demographic indicators.

---

## 🌍 What This Notebook Does

* Loads and cleans a country-level dataset
* Selects meaningful numerical features
* Applies K-Means algorithm to group countries
* Determines optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method, etc.)
* Visualizes cluster results
* Interprets the grouping patterns between countries

---

## 📁 Files

* `Clustering_k-means_country_dta.ipynb` — complete clustering workflow
* Dataset file (CSV) — required for input

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook "Clustering_k-means_country_dta.ipynb"
```

Ensure the dataset is placed in the same folder or update the file path in the notebook.
